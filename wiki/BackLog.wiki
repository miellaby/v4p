#summary Things that might be done in the future of v4P

Here are few things which could be done in future releases.

==new backends==
 # frame buffer backend
 # directFB backend
 # etc.

==targets==
 # Nintendo DS (homebrew)
 # Android

==V4P based libraries and frameworks==
 # transform V4P+LUA experiment into a browser plugin.
 # use V4P as a basis for a full animated GUI stack

==new features==
===anti-aliasing===
A new span-drawing function may handle it.
===curves===
We need facilities to convert curves into vectors.
===import/export===
A real SVG parser would be handy.
===deeper z range, transparent polygons===
Only 16 layers for now. A balanced binary tree of spans may remote this limitation and allow polygons combining (transparency and such).
===accurate math routines===
Byte-length values are really inaccurate!
===dirty rectangles===
A library on top of V4P may avoid unchanged scene area rendering.
